## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddhardha-mns/Rooftop-gardening-webapp.git
cd Rooftop-gardening-webapp
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your API key securely using one of these methods:

### Option A: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for local development)
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Option B: Using Streamlit Secrets (Recommended for deployment)
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
```toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to version control!

## üíª Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Access the application in your web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)

3. Login credentials:
   - Username: Choose from "sanketh", "nikhil", "karthik", "shiva"
   - Password: "rooftop"

   - Track your watering and fertilizing schedules in the top section

## üé§ Using Voice Input

1. Navigate to the Chatbot page
2. Select "Audio" as the input method
3. Upload an audio file containing your gardening question
4. Click "Transcribe Audio" to convert your speech to text
5. Review the transcription and click "Generate Response" to get your answer

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing the Background
To change the background image, modify the URL in the CSS section at the beginning of the script.

### Adding More Users
Extend the `valid_users` list in the `login` function to add more authorized users.

### Adjusting Reminder Times
Modify the duration values in the `calculate_progress` function calls to change how often reminders appear.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub (without API keys or sensitive information)
2. Connect your repository to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Add your API key in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
   - Go to your app's settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets" section
   - Add your API key using this format:
     ```toml
     GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
     ```
4. Deploy your application

### Environment Variables
The application is configured to load the API key from:
1. Environment variables (local development)
2. Streamlit secrets (cloud deployment)
3. User input (fallback for development only)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your API key is correctly set in environment variables or Streamlit secrets
- Check that you've spelled the variable name correctly as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Verify that your API key is valid and has access to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model

### Audio Processing Problems
- Make sure you have the required dependencies for audio processing
- On some systems, additional system libraries may be needed for SpeechRecognition

### Deployment Issues
- Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for specific error messages
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly listed in `requirements.txt`
