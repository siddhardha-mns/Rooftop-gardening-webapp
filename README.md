## üìã Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- An API key for Google's Generative AI (Gemini)
- A Supabase project (URL and ANON key)

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddhardha-mns/Rooftop-gardening-webapp.git
cd Rooftop-gardening-webapp
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your API keys and Supabase credentials securely:

### Option A: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for local development)
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Option B: Using Streamlit Secrets (Recommended for deployment)
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
```toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_url"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_supabase_anon_key"
```

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to version control!

## üíª Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. Access the application in your web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)

3. Login credentials:
   - Username: Choose from "sanketh", "nikhil", "karthik", "shiva"
   - Password: "rooftop"

4. Navigation:
   - Use the sidebar to switch between Home, Chatbot, Prompts, Forum, Contact, Order, and Checkout pages
   - Track your watering and fertilizing schedules in the top section

## üé§ Using Voice Input

1. Navigate to the Chatbot page
2. Select "Audio" as the input method
3. Upload an audio file containing your gardening question
4. Click "Transcribe Audio" to convert your speech to text
5. Review the transcription and click "Generate Response" to get your answer

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing the Background
To change the background image, modify the URL in the CSS section at the beginning of the script.

### Adding More Users
Extend the `valid_users` list in the `login` function to add more authorized users.

### Adjusting Reminder Times
Modify the duration values in the `calculate_progress` function calls to change how often reminders appear.

### Supabase Schema
Create the following tables in your Supabase project (SQL example):

```sql
-- Contacts for the Contact page
create table if not exists contacts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text not null,
  message text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Orders summary
create table if not exists orders (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  customer_name text not null,
  email text not null,
  address text not null,
  total numeric not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Order items
create table if not exists order_items (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  order_id bigint not null references orders(id) on delete cascade,
  product_id bigint not null,
  product_name text not null,
  unit_price numeric not null,
  quantity integer not null
);
```

Ensure your Supabase Project's table policies allow inserts from the ANON key (or configure Row Level Security policies accordingly).

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub (without API keys or sensitive information)
2. Connect your repository to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Add your API key and Supabase credentials in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
   - Go to your app's settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets" section
   - Add your keys using this format:
     ```toml
     GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
     SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_url"
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_supabase_anon_key"
     ```
4. Deploy your application

### Environment Variables
The application is configured to load the API key and Supabase credentials from:
1. Environment variables (local development)
2. Streamlit secrets (cloud deployment)
3. User input for Gemini (fallback for development only)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your API key is correctly set in environment variables or Streamlit secrets
- Check that you've spelled the variable name correctly as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Verify that your API key is valid and has access to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model

### Audio Processing Problems
- Make sure you have the required dependencies for audio processing
- On some systems, additional system libraries may be needed for SpeechRecognition

### Supabase Issues
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
- Ensure the `contacts`, `orders`, and `order_items` tables exist and RLS policies allow inserts

### Deployment Issues
- Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for specific error messages
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly listed in `requirements.txt`
